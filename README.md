Femto-Satelite V2- R1

This is the Femto-Satelite Github develop by Independenxe-X- Aerospace. We are proud to share to the community our hardware and source code of our GerhanaSAT, soon to be the smallest FemtoSat in the world once it is launch to the space. GerhanaSAT is a Femto-class satellite (Femtosatellite) according to mass classification which is lesser than 100g. Independence-X Aerospace plans to launch a constellation of GerhanaSAT into the equatorial low earth orbit for the Internet of Things (IoT)and drone communication services. The mission of the GerhanaSAT is to serve as a communication satellite throughout the equator which contains subsystems such as Attitude Determination Control System (ADCS), Command & Data Handling (C&DH), Electrical Power System (EPS), On-board Computer (OBC), and Communication.

In this repositories, we include the quick datasheet for quick reference, and we will update more and more of the project.

Get excited and contribute more for this project!
